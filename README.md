# Maze Solver Web Application

A Java Spring Boot web application that generates and solves mazes using various pathfinding algorithms.

## Features
- Generates and solves mazes up to **64x64** in size.
- Supports multiple pathfinding algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - A* Algorithm
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Efficient maze solving with real-time visualization.
- Hosted at: [mazestarterproject.onrender.com](https://mazestarterproject.onrender.com)

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Hosting**: Render.com

## How to Use
1. Open the application at [mazestarterproject.onrender.com](https://mazestarterproject.onrender.com).
2. Select the maze size and algorithm.
3. Click "Generate" to create a new maze.
4. Click "Solve" to find the shortest path using the chosen algorithm.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more customization options for maze generation.
- Improve UI/UX with animations and themes.
- Optimize algorithms for even larger mazes.
